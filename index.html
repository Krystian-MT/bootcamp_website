      <h3>Krystian Turlej</h3>
      <p> I have some previous programming experience in python since I did A-Level Computer Science.
        I also have some experience in JavaScript because of a personal project I did, which was a discord bot
        that took specific tweets from twitter using their API, and posted them in a discord channel. Apart from programming
        I am also interested in busiess and investing, I spend some of my free time reading books and doing
        research about those.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Classic brick breaker game, but using bouncing balls instead </h3>
    <p>
      My final programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City. This
      project is a variation of the classic brick breaker game, but instead of bricks, there are
      balls bouncing around the screen. I found creating this game quite challenging, but also
      quite enjoyable. This project demonstrates the use of interaction, methods, loops, groups,
      randomness, and objects and classes. The platform at the bottom of the screen is controlled
      by the movement of the mouse, and the aiming line determines how fast the ball will go, the closer
      to the ball, the slower the velocity. If the ball falls below the platform it will be game over, and the
      objective is to keep the main ball up long enough to destroy all 50 bouncing balls.
